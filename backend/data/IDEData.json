    "content": "An IDE typically consists of: 1) Source code editor: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written. 2) Local build automation: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests. 3) Debugger: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.",
