Docker Desktop includes: Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose -Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, Credential Helper. Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in Docker Hub. This enables development teams to extend their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate using a secure repository. The Containers view provides a runtime view of all your containers and applications. The Images view displays a list of your Docker images and allows you to run an image as a container, pull the latest version of an image from Docker Hub, and inspect images. The Volumes view displays a list of volumes and allows you to easily create and delete volumes and see which ones are being used. ",

When you pause Docker Desktop, the Linux VM running Docker Engine is paused, the current state of all your containers are saved in memory, and all processes are frozen. This reduces the CPU usage and helps you retain a longer battery life on your laptop. You can resume Docker Desktop when you want by clicking the Resume option. From the Docker menu, select whale menu and then Pause to pause Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop displays the paused status on the Docker menu and on the Containers, Images, Volumes, and Dev Environment screens in Docker Dashboard. You can still access the Preferences (or Settings if you are a Windows user) and the Troubleshoot menu from the Dashboard when youâ€™ve paused Docker Desktop.
