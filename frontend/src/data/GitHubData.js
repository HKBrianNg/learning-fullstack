We do all we can to help unlock the creativity of developers and to foster a community of developers that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world. GitHub concentrates on three things: 1) Building a technology platform that is like no other, on which developers can create, share and grow the best code possible, 2) Nurturing a community for developers; a safe and collaborative place that facilitates sharing, amplifies creativity, and supports the principles of open source, 3)Providing access, opening up a community of opportunity, where new developers can be born and where experienced developers can hone their skills and expand their knowledge.",
